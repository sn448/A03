GitHub Tutorial

Definitions:

Git: an open source program that is the core technology used in GitHub. It is used in software development and can track source code changes. 

Github: a system built to host Git repositories and projects

Repository: where all the files for a particular project are stored

Clone: a copy of a repository stored locally on a computer, rather than online. Chnages made on the local version of a clone can be pushed to the remote (online) version to keep both versions in sync when online.

Commit: a record of the changes made to the file. when a revision is made, it must be committed with a commit message for Git to keep track of what was changed. 

Push: sends changes from a local file to a remote repository, like one located on GitHub

Pull: brings in changes from remote repositories to a local file and merges them

Branch: a parallel version of a repository. Changes made here will not affect the main repository branch. Once completed, this branch can be merged with the main branch and published.

Merge: takes changes from one branch and incorporates them into another. 

Merge conflict: occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences between two codes.

Fetch: brings in new remote changes from an online source without merging them into a local file. This allows you to compare changes in the new remote file with the local one.

Remote: the version of a file that is hosted on a server like GitHub.
